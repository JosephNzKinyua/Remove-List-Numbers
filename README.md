# Remove File List Numbers
## Introduction

How often do you find yourself downloading a music playlist that is numbered? Numbering songs, videos, or other items in a list isn't inherently problematic, but it can introduce certain challenges. For instance, when downloading a playlist from someone's YouTube channel, you may encounter redundant videos or audio tracks. 

The first challenge is that you might not notice these repeated songs or videos, as the files will be sorted according to their numerical order rather than their file names. The second challenge is identifying the repeated files, as you won't be able to sort them alphabetically for easy comparison. Another common scenario occurs when you download several playlists and want to merge them into a single folder. Each playlist typically begins its count at "01," resulting in multiple files with the same number, which can be quite untidy, especially if you prefer keeping your playlists organized. Additionally, merging multiple numbered playlists can introduce redundancy, with one or more playlists containing duplicate songs or videos. In rare cases, a single song or video may share the same list number as another playlist.

Given these challenges, dealing with playlist numbers manually can be tedious. That's why I developed this simple tool to help you remove playlist numbers before deciding what to do with your downloaded playlists. Whether you want to tidy them up by removing the numbers, identify redundant files, or combine several playlists, this tool will make the process much easier.

## NOTE
The redundant files will not be renamed; they will retain their original names. However, it's essential to confirm that every file which has not been renamed is indeed redundant. To do this, follow these steps: 

1. Cut the files into a new folder.
2. Use the tool to remove the list numbers from the cut files.
3. Copy or cut them back to the original folder.

If there are redundant files, your copy utility tool will prompt you to decide whether to keep both files. Choose to keep both so you can compare them. If the files are identical, you can delete the copy. If they are not, you may need to choose between the copy and the original file.

Please note that this tool only works on list numbers terminated with a full stop, such as “03.” It ignores numbers like “03” without a full stop because the number might be part of the filename, for example, “10 Daily Reminders For a Better Life - A Monk’s Approach”. In the case of a filename like “03. 10 Daily Reminders For a Better Life - A Monk’s Approach”, the tool will drop the “03.”, and the name will start at “10 ...”.
